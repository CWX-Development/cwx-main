# RULES for creating a folder

Please create as little folders as possible for keeping CWX_Main clean.

## The Rule

In every folder must be an [Foldername].md file, which explains the purpose of the folder.

For example:

RULES.md:

```.md
# RULES folder
In this folder are .md files for every rule.
```

## Naming convention

Use camelCase for naming folders. </br>
Exceptions: Apps or Projects
