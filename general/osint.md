# This is my version about OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).

## What is OSINT?
OSINT is the method of collection information or data from a person, company or more from public available sources like Google or Instagram.

## Is OSINT
Yes! OSINT is legal, as everyone can find those informations and the owner of the data accepted this by posting his data on the public internet.

## Requirements
The only thing you need is a device, that has a connection to the public internet.
This could be a smartphone or a laptop.

Creativity is also a good thing to have.

## How to start
Let's say you want to gatter information about a specific person.

You know the name and in which town the person lives.

Now you can try these steps:

* Snapchat and Instagram
** Create a Snapchat or Instagram account and follow as much people from this town or even friends from your searched person.
** When you follow them, you will probably also find the account of your person and also gatter information about their social status and friends.
** A good thing is also finding the family members of the person.

* Searchengine
** Try typing in the name and the city in a searchengine like Google or Yahoo!. Probably you will find articles or where the person went to school.
