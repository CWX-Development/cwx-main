# Creating a React App

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to create a React app using Create React App.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have following things installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 10 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Step 1: Install Create React App

To create a new React app, we will use Create React App, a command-line tool that sets up a new React project with a basic file structure and development environment.

Open your terminal and run the following command to install Create React App globally:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

## Step 2: Create a New React App

Once Create React App is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to create your new React app. Then, run the following command:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Replace `my-app` with the desired name for your app.

This command will create a new directory called `my-app` and set up a new React app inside it.

## Step 3: Start the Development Server

After the app is created, navigate to the app's directory by running:

```
cd my-app
```

Then, start the development server by running:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your app in a web browser. Any changes you make to your code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

## Step 4: Explore the App

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new React app. Now, you can start exploring the app's file structure and making changes to build your own React components.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a new React app using Create React App. We also started the development server and explored the basic file structure of a React app.
