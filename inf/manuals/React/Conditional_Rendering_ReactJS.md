# React Conditional Rendering

Author: Thuner2007

Conditional rendering is a powerful feature in React that allows you to control what gets rendered based on certain conditions. In this tutorial, we will learn different ways to implement conditional rendering in React.

## Using if-else statements

One way to implement conditional rendering in React is by using if-else statements.

```jsx
if (condition) {
  return <ComponentA />;
} else {
  return <ComponentB />;
}
```

## Using the ternary operator

Another approach to conditional rendering in React is by using the ternary operator.

```jsx
return condition ? <ComponentA /> : <ComponentB />;
```

When condition is true, ComponentA gets rendered, and if condition is false, ComponentB gets rendered.

## Using logical && operator

The logical && operator can also be used for conditional rendering in React.

```jsx
return condition && <ComponentA />;
```

When condition is true, ComponentA gets rendered.

## Using switch statements

If you have multiple conditions to check, you can use switch statements for conditional rendering in React.

```jsx
switch (condition) {
  case 'case1':
    return <ComponentA />;
  case 'case2':
    return <ComponentB />;
  default:
    return <ComponentC />;
}
```

## Conclusion

Conditional rendering is very helpful, when making React apps. It uses less code and is not complicated.
